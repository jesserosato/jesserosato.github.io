{"name":"Jesse Rosato","tagline":"Independent Web Developer, Computer Science Student","body":"# Guys, let's make some stuff?\r\n\r\n### I develop extensible, usable, maintainable webcentric applications.  I use and (try to) contribute to open source projects.  You can read more about me below, or you can [cut to the chase](mailto:jesse.rosato@me.com?subject=Have%2FWe%2FGot%2FA%2FJob%2FFor%2FYou).\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### I LIKE TO\r\n\r\n- Apply computer science-ish phrases like _polymorphic inheritance_ and _time complexity analysis_ to the process of architecting extensible projects for the web.\r\n\r\n- Apply commonly heard English phrases like _\"Wait, it calls itself?\"_ and _\"Fork a get suppository?\"_ to the process of designing usable interfaces for the nerdy parts.\r\n\r\n- Apply my pride in my work to the documentation and support I provide for that work.\r\n\r\n- Work on open source projects and stuff for myself and my friends in my spare time (I was a little bummed when I found out that [Roll20](http//:roll20.net) was already a thing).\r\n\r\n- Cook, especially for the monthly D&D game/dinner party we host for a group of our friends (my wife GMs, we call it _Dinner & Dragons_).\r\n\r\n- Turn off all my screens and enjoy the company of (in this order) my wife, our dogs, our family and friends (tied, slight edge to family, _sorry friends and family_).\r\n\r\n\r\n### IF YOU LIKE TO DO THOSE THINGS TOO\r\n_(But mostly just the first 3 or 4, and frankly, if you like to do the last one, what are you doing hanging out with my wife and dogs and family and friends?  That's a little weird...)_\r\n\r\n- [email](mailto:jesse.rosato@me.com)\r\n\r\n- [twitter](twitter.com/jesserosato)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
