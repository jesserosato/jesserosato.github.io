{"name":"Jesse Rosato","tagline":"Computers: YASSSS!","body":"# Let's make something awesome!\r\n\r\n### I love designing, building and even maintaining software, and I always love meeting other people who feel the same way.\r\n\r\n## Some basic stuff about me\r\n\r\n- I study computer science at CSUS.\r\n- I work with Java code for work.\r\n- I work with open source web languages in my spare time at [Code for Sacramento](htttp://code4sac.org).\r\n\r\n## Some projects that I've worked on recently\r\n\r\n- [WICit](http://findwic.com) ([repo](http://github.com/code4sac/wicit)) is a project to help women more easily find stores that accept [WIC](http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic). WICit was built with [Code for Sacramento](http://code4sac.org) to help showcase the California Department of Public Health's awesome new [open data portal](http://health.data.ca.gov). WICit is built on Node, Express and Angular, and uses the Bootstrap CSS framework.\r\n- I built [lists.io](http://lists.io) with some friends/esteemed colleagues from [Snippet](http://thesnippetapp.com) and [Bamboo Creative](http://bamboocreative.com). Lists is just a really simple way to make and share lists. Lists of your favorite movies, lists of the best articles you found on the web, lists of things you have to do today. Just lists, that's it. The project even won 2nd prize at [Cereal Hack 4](http://cerealhack.challengepost.com/submissions)! Lists.io is built on the Symfony 2 PHP framework, and uses Bootstrap and jQuery on the front-end.\r\n\r\n## Some ways to get in touch with me\r\n\r\n- [email](mailto:jesse.rosato@me.com)\r\n- [twitter](twitter.com/jesserosato)","google":"UA-54452107-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
